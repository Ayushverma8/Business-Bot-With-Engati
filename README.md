# Overview
Chatbots have recently become quite popular. They are being used by businesses to provide proactive assistance to their customers.
Chatbots have grown and improved to capitalize on social media and messenger platforms. Most people haven’t openly identified the true potential of chatbots, so this article is designed to provide helpful chatbot tips for businesses.
*Billions of people are already using chatbots, so it’s time your business did too.*
## The Idea
Ever felt lost and directionless while in a huge mall? 
This bot addresses this problem by providing a **hyper-local map with the relative location** of whatever brand/store, restaurant, restroom/elevator or mall-amenity the user wants to know.  Apart from providing a catalogue of services and stores the mall can offer, the bot also serves a medium for **Business to Consumer(B2C) Marketing** for the brands/stores in the mall to broadcast their latest offers/sales. The bot also provides a functionality to contact the mall help-desk when desired.
**Note** - This bot is targeted for Phoenix Marketcity Pune, as a proof of concept , it only includes a set percentage of all stores currently in the mall.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/viditg2896/Business-Bot-With-Engati/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
